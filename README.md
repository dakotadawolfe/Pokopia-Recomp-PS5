# Pokopia Recomp for PS5

Native PS5 port in development, based on drakolordx7's Pokopia recompilation.
The current build validates the native runtime, executes SDK startup and its
first worker, and serves read-only RomFS storage on PS5. A separate native
graphics diagnostic is ready for presentation testing. Game startup, asset
staging and the game renderer still need integration.
There is no playable PS5 build yet.

See [the PS5 project scope and current status](ps5/README.md). Builds run locally,
using an existing decrypted game dump. The PS5 application will use a fixed
graphics profile and expose controller, audio and save options.

## Upstream Windows project

Pokémon Pokopia (Switch 2) recompiled to run natively on Windows.

[Download the latest build](https://github.com/drakolordx7/pokopia-recomp/releases/latest)

You need your own extracted copy of the game, version 2.0.1a. Not affiliated with Nintendo, The Pokémon Company or Koei Tecmo.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11, 64-bit
- GPU with Vulkan 1.3
- 16 GB of RAM

## Usage

1. Unzip the build and run `PokopiaLauncher.exe`.
2. Pick your dump folder and press Set up. It compiles the game on your PC (about 7 minutes), then builds the shader cache (1 to 2 hours). You can pause it and continue later.
3. Press Play.

F1 opens the settings in game. Middle mouse toggles Joy-Con 2 mouse mode for placing items.

## Reporting problems

[Open an issue](../../issues/new/choose) with `pkp.log` from the session where it happened, your GPU and your Windows version.

## Contributing

- Open pull requests against `main` and say what you tested on which GPU.
- Code for this game goes in `recomp/games/pkp/` and `runtime/games/pkp/`; the rest is shared with other games.
- Building from source needs Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools or newer, LLVM, CMake, Ninja, Python 3.13, .NET 8 SDK, vcpkg with `libvpx:x64-windows-static`, Rust and Node.js. Copy the game's `exefs` files to `game\dump\exefs\`, run `recomp\scripts\build_game.cmd pkp` in a Developer Command Prompt, then `pwsh -File game-build\scripts\build.ps1`. Shaders: [tools/shaders/README.md](tools/shaders/README.md). Launcher: `npm install`, `npm run tauri build` in `launcher\`.
- Runtime tests: `pwsh -File runtime\scripts\build.ps1 -Test`.
